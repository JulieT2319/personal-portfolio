		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<img src="julie.jpg" alt="Julie Theriault head shot" />
		<p>
			I graduated from Brigham Young University in 2011. After graduation I took
			a job at a local market research firm, where I was quickly promoted to
			Lead Programmer. While there I have learned the ins and outs of working in
			a small business, using survey specific software programming and scripting
			packages, and learned how to improve my skills quickly and on the job.
		</p>
		<p>
			I have always loved puzzles and problem solving, particularly logic based
			puzzles. My hobbies are reading, cross stitching, and gaming of all kinds.
			Currently my favorite author is Brandon Sanderson. My current favorite
			downtime activity is listening to an audio book while cross stitching or
			playing Minecraft.
		</p>
		<p>
			Coding and programming have been an interest of mine since my teens. My
			first project was customizing a myspace page in all the glory that was
			early 2000s teen html knowledge. It was a music playing pink webpage that
			I truly wish I still had evidence of.
